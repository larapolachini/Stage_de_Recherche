 * for other robots, and updates the robot's neighbor list if the Euclidean distance (squared)
 * is within the allowed maximum distance.

 * @param dir Direction in which messages are sent (i.e. the ID number of the IR emitter)
 * @param robots A vector of Robot objects. Each Robot must implement a method get_position()
 *               returning a b2Vec2, and contain a public member "neighbors" (e.g., a vector)
 *               that can store pointers to neighboring Robot objects.
